# CodeClauseInternship_Color-Detection
# Color Detection using Python Project

This project focuses on detecting the name of a color based on the RGB values of a pixel in an image. It uses a dataset of color names and their corresponding RGB values to provide insights into the colors present in an image.

## Installation

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Pandas (`pd`)
- NumPy (`np`)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
pip install opencv-python pandas numpy


## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Color Detection Using Python (OvenCv).ipynb` using a Jupyter Notebook environment.

4. Make sure to provide the correct paths for the CSV file and the image you want to analyze.

5. Run each code cell sequentially to perform color detection on the selected image.

6. The program will display the image and wait for your interaction.

7. Double-click on any pixel in the image to detect and print the corresponding color name.

8. Press the 'c' key to display the color name in the console.

9. Press the 'ESC' key to exit the program.

## Files

- `Color Detection Using Python (OvenCv).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for color detection.

- `colors.csv`: CSV file containing color names and their corresponding RGB values.
